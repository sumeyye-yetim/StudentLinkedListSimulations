# StudentLinkedListSimulations
 This repository contains two data structure simulation problems implemented in Java:  Problem 1 – Loose the Letter and Table: A circular one-way linked list is used to simulate a game where players lose letters from their names. Each round randomly selects a player to lose a letter. When a player's name becomes empty, they are eliminated. The last remaining player wins.  Problem 2 – Student Message Transfer Line: A custom doubly linked list is used to simulate students passing a message along a line. The message changes direction upon reaching hub students or the end of the line. Each student keeps track of how many letters in the messages matched their name.  Names used in both problems are read from names.txt.
